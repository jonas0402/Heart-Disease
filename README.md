# Heart Disease Prediction

Machine learning classification project using the UCI Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Overview

This project applies various ML classification algorithms to the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset (14 features, 303 samples) to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
